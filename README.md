# Lucky Gunner System Command Center

## User Story
We need to be able to easily provide access to some aspects of system management to more people in the company without increasing our security exposure with things like shared user credentials or system accounts with sudo privileges. Also, due to our somewhat unique system architecture, namely the exclusive use of proxies in different datacenters for public-facing connections, we have some special needs for a sysadmin platform around updating DNS records. Additionally in later phases of the project we plan to implement features around enabling DDoS protection on the fly and provisioning new systems on demand.
